When detecting the presence/absence of a single photon, the measurement fidelity
is dependent on the quantum efficiency (causing photons to be missed) and the “dark
counts” of the detector (positive detections when no photon is present). Typical unfil-
tered detection efficiencies are 85% at 660 nm, with dark counts at ∼6 000 s−1 at room
temperature, or only 25 s−1 at cryogenic temperatures [117]. Superconducting detectors
can reach 95% efficiency, but are relatively slow [118]. Not all detectors can measure
photon number; most have some recovery time during which subsequent photons are not
counted. The KLM scheme requires high-efficiency photon-number discriminating de-
tectors; these are currently being developed, for example the visible light photon counter
(VLPC) which has 88% quantum efficiency at 694 nm [119]
